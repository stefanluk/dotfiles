### :fish:&nbsp; Fish
I use [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) as a Fishshell Framework.
These are the plugins I'm using:

- [bobthefish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish)
- [thefuck](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck)

I use [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) as my plugin manager.
These are the plugins I'm using:

- [FZF Fish](https://github.com/patrickF1/fzf.fish)
- [Z](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z)

To update fish plugins, type in `fisher update` in terminal.
To install or remove fish plugins, you can run `fisher` command.

### :memo:&nbsp; Vim

I use [Vimplug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as my plugin manager.

## :package:&nbsp; Dependencies

You need to have these packages installed in your system if you want to set up:

**For Fish:**

```
fish

## :abcd:&nbsp; Fonts

Bobthefish requires powerline fonts to work.
I suggest [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
Currently I'm using [Droid Sans Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DroidSansMono).
